# Infi-Site
A very small site that gives random theorems from Calculus 1(course number 20474) in the openu that needs to be memorized for the test in semester 2020b.
DISCLAIMER: The wording of the theoroms are heavily based on the Open University of Israel's wording, and therefore I do not take credit for them.
